# GitHub Profile Setup Guide

This guide helps you maximize your GitHub contribution graph to show nearly 90% activity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable the GitHub Actions Workflow

The snake animation in your profile requires GitHub Actions:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Enable GitHub Actions if not already enabled
3. Go to the Actions tab and manually run the "Generate Snake Animation" workflow

### 2. Maximize Contribution Visibility

To ensure your GitHub profile shows more contributions:

1. **Make your repositories public**: Only public contributions count in your profile by default
2. **Enable contribution visibility for private repositories**:
   - Go to your GitHub profile settings
   - Navigate to "Profile" section
   - Check "Include private contributions on my profile"

3. **Contribute consistently**:
   - Make small, frequent commits rather than large infrequent ones
   - Contribute to open-source projects
   - Create issues and pull requests on other repositories
   - Review pull requests
   - Submit code reviews

### 3. Additional Profile Enhancements

Your profile includes several dynamic components that refresh automatically:

- **GitHub Stats Card**: Updates with your latest activity
- **GitHub Streak Stats**: Shows your contribution streak
- **Top Languages Card**: Displays languages used in your repositories
- **Activity Graph**: Shows contribution frequency visually
- **Snake Animation**: Visualizes your contribution grid as a snake game

## üîÑ Troubleshooting

If your contribution graph isn't showing up correctly:

1. Make sure your email in Git configuration matches your GitHub email
2. Verify your commits are properly linked to your GitHub account
3. Check that GitHub Actions is enabled and the workflow is running
4. Remember that it may take up to 24 hours for new contributions to appear

## üìù Further Customization

You can customize the appearance of your stats cards by modifying parameters in the URLs:

- Change themes by modifying `theme=tokyonight` to another theme
- Adjust layout with `layout=compact` or other options
- Hide specific stats with `hide=stars,commits` parameters
