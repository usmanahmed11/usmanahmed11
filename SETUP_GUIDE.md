# GitHub Profile Setup Guide for usmanahmed11

This guide will help you set up your visually appealing GitHub profile that matches your portfolio website.

## Step 1: Create a Special Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub with the name "usmanahmed11" (which is your GitHub username).

## Step 2: Upload the Files

1. Upload the `README.md` file to your new repository.
2. Create a `.github/workflows` directory and upload the `snake.yml` file there.

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Actions

The snake animation in your contribution graph requires GitHub Actions to be enabled:

1. Go to your repository's Settings > Actions > General and ensure Actions are enabled.
2. Make sure to grant workflow permissions to "Read and write permissions" under Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions.

## Step 4: Customize Further (Optional)

You can further customize your profile by:

1. Adding more badges for technologies you use (find badges at [shields.io](https://shields.io/))
2. Adding more projects from your portfolio website
3. Customizing colors and themes in the GitHub stats cards

## About the Components

1. **Header Animation**: The typing animation that cycles through your roles/titles
2. **Tech Stack Badges**: Visual representation of your skills
3. **GitHub Stats Cards**: Dynamic cards showing your GitHub activity metrics
4. **Snake Animation**: A fun animation showing your contribution graph as a snake game
5. **Social Media Links**: Links to your LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube accounts

## Troubleshooting

- If the GitHub stats cards are not showing up, ensure your GitHub account has public repositories
